## EVENT DESCRIPTION
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are abundant components of eukaryotic proteomes and are centrally involved in disease mechanisms, ranging from pathogenic to host proteins. This workshop will cover basic and advanced aspects of how IDPs contribute to disease mechanisms through five training bootcamp sessions to be held in a virtual format, and one in-person event to be held in person at UNSAM University. A dedicated career development roundtable will cover different aspects of career advancement in bioinformatic and biological research.

## EVENT REGISTRATION
Participation requires registration but the event is free (no registration fee). Training Bootcamps will be held by Zoom and participation in the training sessions requires each participant to have a personal computer. Participants should have a basic knowledge on protein function and structure. Programing skills are not required but are a plus.
